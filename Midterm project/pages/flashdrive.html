            <p>This device here can help any person who is bored and tired of watching commercials. With this drive you will never have to sit around during commercial or have to get up and walk around to buy time till your show is back. But most importantly skipping commercials means that you cut out 15% of the show by removing commercial and that will give you more time to do other things as well. The drive works by adjusting the tv guide shown on your television by pushing programs back 15% to remove the commercials. During sporting events becasue fan still want to watch them live the drive either switches the input of the tv to a game consoul or will put on a television show during what should be the commercial then at the end of the commercial break the drive will automaticly switch you back to the game.</p>
            <p>This device was made to make television more enjoyable. Everyone loves to watch television but hates dealing with the comercials and people and companies have made strides trying to eliminate them but we have finally figured out the most efficent way to do it.</p>
            <p>The CE drive was relased October 8 and is now avalible starting at only $149.99 you can get CE drive for your home and if you order today your shipping will only take 4-8 business days.</p>
