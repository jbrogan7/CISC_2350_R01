		      	<h3>About us</h3>
		      	<p>Our company is located on the coner of 8th avenue and west 49th street midtown Manhatten. Our company Simple tech started in the basement of our CEO's house when he was in his late 20's we did not have enough money for anything. All five of the original emploies would bring our own laptops to do their work on at the begining.</p>
		      	<p>Our CEO is the one and only Jeff Probst who most people know as the host of Survior on CBS. However peopl do not know that when Jeff was younger he started Simple tech back in 2014 but no one really knew about it. Jeff tried going to the produces of Survivor to ask for some advertising but they refused and cut any refrence to the company out of the show.</p>
		      	<p>Finally in 2016 the company finally started to gain some traction. That is why in 2016 we came out with the spy pen and the smart glasses.</p>
