		<p>My see I have this swim coach named Charlie Brown that I have known for so long its like 10<sup>10</sup>. Infact this man even thought me how to swim. Anyway, Charlie brown was my swim coach at <a href="https://www.cedarbrookcc.org/Home" target="_blank">Cedarbrook Country Club</a>.</p>
		<p>Now back when I was 8 my days consited of only really two things baseball and swimming and everyday went exactly the same I would wake up for 10:00 swim practice at 9:50 hop in the car with my babysitter and brothers and go to the pool. We would get to the pool with only minutes till practiced started we hop out the car and sprint to the pool and once we entered the gate and we would see Charlie and he would yell, "it's the Brogan's! Hurry up." And we would run and join a game of keep the ball in the air.</p>
		<p>Once practice started we were smiling and working hard becasue Charlie was yelling and motavating us and keeping the entire pactice at like energy level 10. Once practice was over Charlie would alwasy hang around the pool and help us with strokes or play games like dot or red rover with us and he alwasy looked like he was having hte time of his life.</p>
			<ol>As I got older I realized a couple of things:<!-- ordered list -->
