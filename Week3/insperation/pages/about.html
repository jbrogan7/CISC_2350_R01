		<p>Right before champs one year Charlie told us all about this story about how some of the older kids on the team when they were younger. he told us how they were behind going into the last two swimers in the relay. But then the last two kids swam out of their minds and caught up and won. He told us how there was not a viedo of it. So instead he played this video from the 2008 Olympics.</p>

		<p>This next video was from one of our meets that eneded in a tie. However the interesting thing about country club swimming is that when a meet ends in a tie you do something called a Crescendo relay where your best swimmer from each age group swims in the same relay. The video is of the Crescendo relay.</p>
